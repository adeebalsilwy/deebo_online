//////////////////////// Solution 1
The problem is that the Android emulator maps 10.0.2.2 to 127.0.0.1,
not to localhost. So configure your web server to serveron 127.0.0.1:54722
and not localhost:54722. That should do it.

After running your local host you get http://localhost:[port number]/ here you found your port number.

Then get your IP address from Command, Open your windows command and type ipconfig enter image description here

In my case, IP was 192.168.10.33 so my URL will be http://192.168.10.33:[port number]/. In Android, the studio uses this URL as your URL. And after that set your URL and your port number in manual proxy for the emulator.

I have a webserver running on my localhost.

If I open up the emulator and want to connect to my localhost I am using 192.168.x.x. This means you should use your local lan ip address. By the way, your HttpResponseException (Bad Request) doesn't mean that the host is not reachable.

Some other errors lead to this exception.
